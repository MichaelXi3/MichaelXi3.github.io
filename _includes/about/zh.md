Hi, It's Michael Xi. :)

I am currently a senior at Wake Forest University, majoring in computer science with a minor in statistics. During my time at Wake Forest, I discovered my passion for software engineering and decided to apply it to projects that benefit our community. Two years ago, I co-founded AppDev and have been working towards my goals ever since. Our team has initiated several impactful projects, including Eatery, Deacon Emojis, and WFU Covid, which provide support to both students and parents in various ways. Additionally, I am a member of the System Security and Privacy Lab, where I am involved in developing an Android provenance system to ensure accountability for malicious activities in applications.

My professional objective is to become a software engineer specializing in cloud and big data infrastructure. I am passionate about exploring the potential of big data and leveraging it to enhance AI and security systems.

Below is my favorite quote from my high school English teacher, Mr. Campbell.

> Be present.

> 
>
> Hear the birds call your name. Feel your heart break at a relationship's end. Notice the rainwater collecting inside your shoes. Study your mother's expression when she speaks of her youth. Inhabit each moment in your life, be it a heaven or a hell.

> For by inhabiting each moment, you shall perceive with clarity. You will notice details and expressions and subtleties which evade most people, and— just as in literature— through studying the nuance of a situation, you will unlock a deeper, richer meaning. This meaning will vary from scene to scene; what unfolds before you may be a lesson in the delicate subtleties of society, or perhaps a lesson in the inner truths of a cherished friend. Quite often, it will be a lesson about yourself: about your misplaced anxieties, or your own inner truths, or about the subjectivity which you have for so long taken to be objectivity.

> These meanings and lessons lay the stage for what is arguably the true aim of education: transformation of the self. You will take what you've learned, incorporate it into your understanding of the world, and modify your conduct ever so slightly. And then, you will discern a new truth. You will again expand your understanding, you will again modify your conduct in preparation for what next you will learn. And on and on this will go, ad infinitum, because educated people— truly educated people— recognize that the world's change is eternal, and thus so is our own.
