Hi, It's Michael Xi. :)

I am currently a senior at Wake Forest University, pursuing a double major in computer science and mathematical business, with a minor in statistics. During my time at Wake Forest, I discovered my passion for software engineering and decided to apply it to projects that benefit our community. Two years ago, I co-founded AppDev and have been working towards my goals ever since. Our team has initiated several impactful projects, including Eatery, Deacon Emojis, and WFU Covid, which provide support to both students and parents in various ways. More information about these initiatives can be found on the official website of AppDev: [wakeappdev.com](http://wakeappdev.com/). Additionally, I am a member of the System Security and Privacy Lab, where I am involved in developing an Android provenance system to ensure accountability for malicious activities in applications.

My professional objective is to become a software engineer specializing in cloud computing and big data processing infrastructure. I am passionate about exploring the potential of big data and leveraging it to enhance AI and security systems.
