Hi, It's Michael Xi. :)

I'm currently a junior double majoring in computer science and mathematical business with a statistics minor at Wake Forest University. While at Wake Forest, I found my passion in software engineering and decided to apply it to building projects that benefit our community. I co-founded AppDev the past year and have been working toward my goal. These days, we've started a number of worthwhile initiatives, such as Eatery, Deacon Emojis, WFU Covid, etc., that support both students and parents in many ways. (More information can be found at wakeappdev.com, the official website of AppDev.)

My professional objective is to obtain a developer position that can have a beneficial impact on people as a result of my experience from the previous year. I'm very motivated on any level by the prospect of using my technical expertise to bring positive impacts to others.#### Appearence
